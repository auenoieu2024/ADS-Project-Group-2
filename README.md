#Intorduction
As a student who travels, I want to input my trip details easily so that the app can automatically create a suggested packing list according to my trip details that will fit my luggage. I want an easy way to create a packing list that fits my destination, activities, the weather, and trip length. The app should suggest a packing list and Ill be able to edit, add, and delete items on the form. Lastly, the app should be able to estimate the luggage weight based on the things I’ll be bringing.
